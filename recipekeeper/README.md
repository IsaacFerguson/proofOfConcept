To run this program, make sure you have python and pip 
installed. Mac users will already have them installed,
and Windows users can use [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/) link to install python 
and pip. Once you have those installed, you need to install 
two python libraries, beautiful soup, and requests. To install 
them, type: -m pip install beautifulsoup4, -m pip install requests.
